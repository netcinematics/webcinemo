ARTISTICALLY STYLIZED POLICY

It is the express intent of NetCinematics that no asset be included directly as is, but to have been artistically enhanced for stylized homogeny in some clear way. By policy, it is our meticulous artistic hypothesis to see if PUBLIC DOMAIN digital assets can be combined into triple A Web Entertainment, and only where possibly lawfully, we encourage others to continue to share-alike for the benefit of the state-of the art, for the world wide web.

COMMITMENT TO IMMEDIATE REMOVAL

Through the following contact below, and upon receiving credible word that some asset should be removed, NetCinematics commits to quickly review the credentials, increment our software version, with removal of the asset from our artistic work immediately. We do this with a commitment to quality, and the pursuit of maintaining with highest scrutiny, a pure DIGITAL-CREATIVE-COMMONS-ART-FORM. For more information contact alpinefalcon@protonmail.com Attn: LegalCouncil.

SHARE-ALIKE

The starting point of everything above is also available to you. In addition if you would like a copy of our artistically enhanced assets please contact us at alpinefalcon@protonmail.com Attn: CreativeContentCurator.
